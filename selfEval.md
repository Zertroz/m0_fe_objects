# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? Some of the instructions were a little unclear, but with some *productive struggle* I got through it.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? Keeping track of vocabulary and what each thing does helps the most. The actual code is difficult to write in a notebook, so I try to do that on replit.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? Trying to solve it first. Which means I sometimes spend way more time than I should on a question, but it means I can work through my problems organically, without relying on others. Of course, if I'm not gettin anywhere with that, then I resort to Google or friends.
